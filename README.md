# RockScissorPaper-python
This is my own simple python project I had done to practice my python.
I ran into some error and corrected it with the help of ChatGPT.
I also take note of my own code before and after correction in order for me to refer my mistakes. (That's why there are some weird #Comments in my code)
This is my first time using github too.
